![ClineFlow — Persistent Context, Open Knowledge](assets/clineflow-okf-cover.png)

## The memory layer for AI coding agents

ClineFlow turns engineering context into portable, version-controlled knowledge. It adopts the [Open Knowledge Format introduced by Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/how-the-open-knowledge-format-can-improve-data-sharing) and targets the [OKF v0.2 specification](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/knowledge-catalog/blob/main/okf/SPEC.md), so people and agents share the same Markdown and YAML knowledge graph—without a platform, service, or lock-in.

## Why Open Knowledge Format?

The [Google Cloud introduction to OKF](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/how-the-open-knowledge-format-can-improve-data-sharing) describes a deliberately small, open contract for AI-ready knowledge: Markdown files for the human-readable narrative, YAML frontmatter for queryable metadata, normal links for relationships, and optional indexes and logs for progressive discovery and history. It is a format—not a service or SDK—so the same knowledge can move between people, coding agents, repositories, and tools.

That matters because reliable AI coding depends on context that survives the chat that created it. ClineFlow had already been built around many of the practices OKF formalizes: keeping task history beside the code, capturing decisions and verification, making context discoverable before work begins, and staying independent of any one agent or vendor. The native `knowledge/` bundle makes those conventions interoperable: every new task becomes a typed Engineering Journal concept, connected through standard Markdown, versioned with the project, and usable by any conforming producer or consumer.

- **Persistent context:** task history, decisions, tests, and next steps survive every session.
- **Open knowledge:** `knowledge/` is a readable, Git-native OKF bundle with indexes, links, and change history.
- **Agent-agnostic workflow:** Cline, Cursor, Copilot, Windsurf, and future tools receive the same instructions.
- **No added runtime:** the default validator is Bash-only; full YAML parsing is available through optional strict mode.

Existing `docs/journals/` directories remain supported as read-only legacy context. New work is always written to `knowledge/journals/`.

Read the [OKF knowledge workflow guide](docs/okf-knowledge-workflow.md) for the architecture, validation model, and upgrade behavior.

> 💡 **New to AI Coding Assistants?**
> 
> AI coding assistants like Cline, Cursor, and GitHub Copilot write code, edit files, and execute commands through natural conversation.
> 
> **Popular Options:**
> - **[Cline](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=saoudrizwan.claude-dev)** - VS Code extension (our primary platform)
> - **[Cursor](https://cursor.com)** - AI-first IDE
> - **[GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot)** - GitHub's AI assistant

---

## 🎯 Easy as 1-2-3

New task journals live at `knowledge/journals/<task>.md`, use YAML frontmatter, and are validated with:

```bash
./validate-okf
```

The bundled validator uses Bash only; no additional runtime or package installation is required.

For full YAML parsing in environments that already use Python, strict validation is optional:

```bash
python3 -m pip install PyYAML
./validate-okf --strict
```

**Turn Cline into a teammate who remembers everything**

### 1️⃣ Install ClineFlow

**Option 1: From VS Code (in your AI assistant)**

Using Cline, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Windsurf, or any AI coding assistant - just start a new task and type:

```
Please install and setup clineflow here, from: https://github.com/hassanvfx/clineflow
```

**Option 2: From Terminal**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hassanvfx/clineflow/main/install.sh | bash
```

### 2️⃣ Ask your AI assistant "How can we work?"
Your AI assistant reads your project's workflow and becomes context-aware. Through journals, every conversation builds on the last - **it remembers what you built, why you built it, and what's next.**

### 3️⃣ Say "please commit"
Your AI assistant automatically:
- 📝 Documents your decisions in the active journal
- 💾 Commits code + updated journal together
- 🔄 Creates context for your next session

**Result:** Every new task starts with full context. No more "what did we do last time?" 🎉

---

## 🌍 Agent-Agnostic Architecture

**ClineFlow automatically configures itself for multiple AI assistants.** During installation, it creates configuration files for:

- ✅ **Cline** (`.clinerules`) - *Fully tested by core team*
- ✅ **Cursor** (`AGENTS.md`)
- ✅ **GitHub Copilot** (`.github/copilot-instructions.md`)
- ✅ **Windsurf** (`.windsurf/rules/`)
- ✅ **Future agents** - Ready for any tool that emerges

**Why multiple config files?** Different AI assistants use different configuration formats. ClineFlow generates all of them from a single template, so it "just works" regardless of which tool you use.

**Current Status:** Core team actively develops and tests with Cline. Community members are welcome to test and contribute support for other agents!

> 💡 **Using a different agent?** The installation works the same - ClineFlow will create the appropriate config files automatically.

## 🔗 Cross-Team Code Access

> **Simple alternative to MCP fileserver** - Give Cline instant access to your entire organization's codebase

### The Problem

Your team works across multiple repositories. Cline needs context from:
- Backend APIs
- Frontend applications  
- Shared libraries
- Documentation repos
- Legacy systems

**Traditional solution:** Complex MCP fileserver setup with running processes and network overhead.

**ClineFlow solution:** 3-line config file. Done.

### MCP Fileserver vs ClineFlow References

| MCP Fileserver | ClineFlow References |
|----------------|---------------------|
| ❌ Complex server configuration | ✅ Simple config file |
| ❌ Requires running process | ✅ Native filesystem symlinks |
| ❌ Per-developer setup | ✅ Team shares one config |
| ❌ Network latency | ✅ Instant local access |
| ❌ Additional dependencies | ✅ Zero dependencies |

### How It Works

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Your Project] --> B[.clineflow.local<br/>Config File]
    B --> C[Backend API]
    B --> D[Frontend App]
    B --> E[Shared Libs]
    C --> F[🤖 Cline Explores<br/>All Repos]
    D --> F
    E --> F
    style B fill:#238636
    style F fill:#1f6feb
```

**Result:** Cline can explore and reference any linked repository as if it's part of your current project.

### 30-Second Setup

1. **Edit one config file:**
   ```bash
   cp .clineflow.example .clineflow.local
   nano .clineflow.local
   ```

2. **Add your repo paths:**
   ```bash
   BACKEND_API_PATH="/path/to/backend-api"
   FRONTEND_APP_PATH="/path/to/frontend-app"
   SHARED_LIBS_PATH="/path/to/shared-libraries"
   ```

3. **Run setup:**
   ```bash
   ./setup-refs.sh
   ```

**That's it.** Cline now has access to all repos.

### Cross-Team Use Cases

**Full-Stack Development:**
```
You: "How does the frontend call the user authentication API?"
Cline: Reads backend API, frontend code, shows complete flow
```

**Microservices:**
```
You: "Which services depend on the payment service?"
Cline: Scans all linked repos, finds dependencies
```

**Onboarding:**
```
New Dev: "Explain the architecture"
Cline: Navigates across all repos, provides complete overview
```

**Refactoring:**
```
You: "I'm changing this shared library function"
Cline: Finds all usages across every linked repository
```

### Team Benefits

✅ **Share config in git** - Everyone gets same setup  
✅ **No server maintenance** - Just filesystem symlinks  
✅ **Instant updates** - Changes sync automatically  
✅ **Zero overhead** - Native file access  
✅ **Works offline** - No network required

### Git Safety Built-In

**The reference system automatically handles git exclusion:**

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[setup-refs.sh] --> B[Create Symlinks]
    B --> C[Configure<br/>.git/info/exclude]
    C --> D[✅ Visible in VSCode]
    C --> E[✅ Ignored by Git]
    style C fill:#238636
    style D fill:#238636
    style E fill:#238636
```

**Why this matters:**
- Symlinks contain absolute paths specific to each developer
- Committing them would break for other developers
- `.git/info/exclude` keeps them local-only but visible
- No `.gitignore` complexity needed

**Example:**
```
Developer A: clineflow/backend-api → /Users/alice/repos/backend-api
Developer B: clineflow/backend-api → /home/bob/projects/backend-api
```
Both work perfectly. No conflicts. Ever.

### Advanced Configuration

**Full details:** See [clineflow/README.md](template/clineflow/README.md) for advanced features:
- Automatic symlink management
- Git exclusion handling
- Clean mode for fresh starts
- Integration with build tools

    C --> D[✍️ Create Message]
    D --> E[✅ Commit Done]
    style A fill:#1f6feb
    style E fill:#238636
```

Traditional workflow requires 5+ manual steps. ClineFlow: **One phrase.**

### 📝 Persistent Context
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Session 1<br/>Build Feature] --> B[📖 Journal]
    B --> C[💾 Git Commit]

    D --> E[🧠 Complete Context]
    E --> F[Session 3<br/>Enhanced AI]
    style B fill:#238636
    style E fill:#238636
```

**Never repeat yourself again.** Each session builds on the last.

### 🏗️ Professional Code Organization

Built-in guidelines ensure maintainable code:

- **Module/File Size**: 300-500 LOC ideal, >1K LOC unacceptable
- **Single Responsibility**: Each file has one clear purpose
- **Composition Over Monoliths**: Break large files into focused units

**Universal:** Works for any language - Python classes, JavaScript components, Go packages, Rust modules, etc.

### 🔄 Multi-Task Journals

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Task 1: Initial Build] --> B[Same Journal]
    B --> C[Task 2: Bug Fix]
    C --> B
    B --> D[Task 3: Enhancement]
    D --> B
    style B fill:#238636
```

Keep related work in one place. Complete context for entire feature lifecycle.

### Reference System (Optional)

> 💡 **Super Easy Setup - Just Ask Cline!**
> 
> Instead of following manual steps, you can simply ask Cline:
> 
> *"In this project I need to setup cline refs to project-a and project-b which live in the parent folder (repos) to this. Can you help me?"*
> 
> Cline will read the documentation and set everything up for you automatically! ✨

**Example conversation:**
```
You: "I need to setup cline refs to my-backend-api and my-frontend-app 
      which are sibling directories in the parent repos folder."

Cline: "I'll help you set up the reference system. I can see you need:
        - my-backend-api (at ../my-backend-api)
        - my-frontend-app (at ../my-frontend-app)
        
        I'll create the config file and run the setup script."
        
[Cline creates .clineflow.local, adds paths, runs ./setup-refs.sh]

Cline: "✅ Reference system configured! You can now use:
        @clineflow/my-backend-api/path/to/file
        @clineflow/my-frontend-app/path/to/file"
```

**Link other codebases for Cline exploration** - useful when you want Cline to have context from external projects.

**What it does:**
- Creates symlinks in `clineflow/` pointing to other repositories
- Cline can explore those repos using @ mentions: `@clineflow/backend-api/README.md`
- No file duplication - changes sync instantly via symlinks

**Quick setup (3 steps):**

1. **Clone external repos** wherever you prefer:
   ```bash
   cd ~/projects
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/backend-api
   ```

2. **Configure paths** in your project:
   ```bash
   # Copy example config
   cp .clineflow.example .clineflow.local
   
   # Edit with your paths
   nano .clineflow.local
   ```
   
   Add your repository paths:
   ```bash
   BACKEND_API_PATH="/Users/yourname/projects/backend-api"
   FRONTEND_APP_PATH="/Users/yourname/projects/frontend-app"
   ```

3. **Run the setup script** (included with ClineFlow):
   ```bash
   ./setup-refs.sh
   ```

**Result:** Cline can now explore linked repos as if they were part of your project!

#### Git Safety 🔒

**Symlinks are local-only and developer-specific:**
- ✅ **Visible in VSCode** - Full file explorer access
- ✅ **Never committed** - Automatically excluded via `.git/info/exclude`
- ✅ **No conflicts** - Each developer has their own paths
- ✅ **Team-ready** - Share config, not symlinks

**How it works:**
- `setup-refs.sh` automatically configures `.git/info/exclude`
- This is like `.gitignore` but local-only (never committed)
- Symlinks stay visible but git ignores them completely
- Each developer can have different repository locations

**Safety checks:**
- ⚠️ Warns if symlinks are accidentally staged for commit
- ✅ Provides clear remediation instructions
- ✅ Works in both git and non-git projects

**Full details:** See [clineflow/README.md](template/clineflow/README.md) for advanced configuration.

#### Troubleshooting: @ Mentions Not Working?

**Problem:** When typing `@` in Cline, symlinked files don't appear in autocomplete.

**Solution:** Use the generated workspace file for full @ mention completion:

```bash
# Re-run setup to generate/update workspace file
./setup-refs.sh

# Open project with workspace file (enables @ completion)
code my-project.code-workspace
```

**Why this works:**
- Symlinks alone provide filesystem access but not VS Code indexing
- Multi-root workspace makes all repos fully indexed by VS Code
- Cline's @ mention feature depends on VS Code's file index
- Workspace file = complete autocomplete for all linked repositories

**What you get with workspace file:**
- ✅ Full @ mention autocomplete in Cline chat
- ✅ Search works across all repositories
- ✅ IntelliSense recognizes linked code
- ✅ Keeps symlinks for backward compatibility

**Idempotent upgrade:** Safe to re-run `./setup-refs.sh` anytime - it updates the workspace file without breaking existing setups.
